URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5634
### 0. Abstract
* Learn from multi-view data using three approaches:
  *Co-training - maximize mutual agreement on two views of data
  *Multiple kernal training - combine kernels
  *Subspace learning - obtain latent subspace shared by multiple views
* Success of multi-view learning mainly relies on consensus principle and complementary principle
