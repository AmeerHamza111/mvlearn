class MultiviewKMeans(BaseKMeans):

    '''
    An implementation of Multi-View K-Means using the co-EM algorithm.
    This algorithm currently handles two views of data.

    Parameters
    ---------
    n_clusters : int, optional, default=2
        The number of clusters

    random_state : int, optional, default=None
        Determines random number generation for initializing centroids.
        Can seed the random number generator with an int.

    patience : int, optional, default=5
        The number of EM iterations with no decrease in the objective
        function after which the algorithm will terminate.

    max_iter : int, optional, default=None
        The maximum number of EM iterations to run before
        termination.

    n_init : int, optional, default=5
        Number of times the k-means algorithm will run on different
        centroid seeds. The final result will be the best output of
        n_init runs with respect to total inertia across all views.

    init : {'k-means++', 'random'} or list of array-likes
        Method of initializing centroids, defaults to 'k-means++'.

        'k-means++': selects initial cluster centers for k-means clustering
        via a method that speeds up convergence.

        'random': choose n_cluster samples from the data for the initial
        centroids.

        If a list of array-likes is passed, the list should have a length of
        equal to the number of views. Each of the array-likes should have
        the shape

    Attributes
    ----------

    centroids_ : list of array-likes
        - centroids_ length: n_views
        - centroids_[i] shape: (n_clusters, n_features_i)
        The cluster centroids for each of the two views. centroids_[0]
        corresponds to the centroids of view 1 and centroids_[1] corresponds
        to the centroids of view 2.
