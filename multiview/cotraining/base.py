class BaseCoTrainEstimator(BaseEstimator):
    """
    A base class for multiview co-training. Extends from sklearn's
    BaseEstimator.
    Parameters
    ----------
    estimator1 : estimator object, default (None)
        The estimator object which will be trained on view 1 of the data.

    estimator2 : estimator object, default (None)
        The estimator object which will be trained on view 2 of the data.
        Does not need to be of the same type as estimator1.

    Attributes
    ----------
    estimator1 : estimator object
        The estimator used on view 1.

    estimator2 : estimator object
        The estimator used on view 2.

    class_name: string
        The name of the class.

    n_views_ : int
        The number of views supported by the multi-view classifier

    classes_ : array-like of shape (n_classes,)
        Unique class labels.

    n_classes_ : int
        Number of unique classes.

    p_ : int
        Number of positive examples (second label in classes_) to pull from
        unlabeled_pool and give "label" at each training round. When the
        labels are 0 or 1, positive is defined as 1, and in general, positive
        is the larger label.

    n_ : int
        Number of negative examples (second label in classes_) to pull from
        unlabeled_pool and give "label" at each training round. when the
        labels are 0 or 1, negative is defined as 0, and in general, negative
        is the smaller label.

    unlabeled_pool_size_ : int
        Size of pool of unlabeled_pool examples to classify at each iteration.

    num_iter_ : int
        Maximum number of training iterations to run.
